# @scayle/storefront-application-testing

A comprehensive testing suite for the SCAYLE Storefront Application. This package provides end-to-end testing capabilities using Playwright and load testing with Artillery.

## Overview

This testing suite is designed to ensure the reliability, performance, and user experience of SCAYLE-powered ecommerce storefronts. It includes both functional testing and performance testing tools.

## Testing Components

### 🎭 Playwright E2E Testing (`/playwright/`)

### ⚡ Artillery Load Testing (`/artillery/`)

Performance and load testing framework for stress testing storefront applications.

**Features:**

- HTTP and Playwright-based load testing
- Configurable test scenarios and phases
- Realistic user behavior simulation
- Performance metrics and reporting

**Test Types:**

- **Load Tests**: Normal expected traffic patterns
- **Stress Tests**: High-volume traffic scenarios

### Environment Variables

Take the `.env.example` file in the Storefront Application root as basis and populate your own local `.env` file:

```env
#############################
# TESTING: Playwright (E2E) #
#############################

### PLAYWRIGHT E2E TEST USERS ###
# As a prerequisite to successfully run the any end-to-end test that requires user authentication, the following environment variables should be set:
# Dedicated test user for Chromium in tests that are prone to conflicts (e.g. adding product to Basket in parallel for all browsers).
# This user is also used as a default test user across the Storefront Boilerplate end-to-end tests suite.
TEST_USER_EMAIL1=
# Dedicated test user for desktop Firefox.
TEST_USER_EMAIL2=
# Dedicated test user for desktop Webkit (Safari).
TEST_USER_EMAIL3=
# Dedicated test user for mobile Chrome.
TEST_USER_EMAIL4=
# Dedicated test user for mobile Webkit (Safari).
TEST_USER_EMAIL5=
# Test user with no orders placed. Used to verify Orders page empty state.
TEST_USER_NO_ORDERS=
# Password (the same for all test users listed above).
TEST_USER_PASSWORD=
# Password used for test that verifies user authentication with wrong credentials.
TEST_USER_WRONG_PASSWORD=

### PLAYWRIGHT E2E SEARCH TERMS ###
# As a prerequisite to successfully run the Search end-to-end tests, the following environment variables should be set.
# Search term that doesn't match any category name, so the search suggestions are not shown, e.g. some product brand.
E2E_SEARCH_TERM_PRODUCT=
# Search term that fully or partially matches category name, e.g. "shirt" or "shirts".
E2E_SEARCH_TERM_CATEGORY_SUGGESTION=
# Search term that matches exact product ID, e.g. 123456.
E2E_SEARCH_EXACT_PRODUCT_ID=
# Descriptive search term that returns search suggestion tags in search suggestions list, e.g. "Black shoes size 44".
E2E_SEARCH_TAGS=
# Search term that fully or partially matches a (content) page, e.g. "faq" or "support".
E2E_SEARCH_PAGE=
# Search term that matches the exact product reference key, e.g. "123-ref-key".
E2E_SEARCH_REFERENCE_KEY=

# Arrival rates for Load Test (3 phases)
# The arrival rate is the number of new virtual users that Artillery will create per second.

ARTILLERY_LOAD_ARRIVAL_RATE_P3=7

# The rampTo parameter is used in combination with arrivalRate to create a gradually increasing load.
# It defines the target number of new virtual users per second that the test will reach by the end of the phase.
# For example, if duration is 10, arrival rate is 2, and ramp to is 10, Artillery will start by injecting 2 users per second
# and will gradually increase that rate until it's injecting 10 users per second by the 10th second.

# Scenario weights (percentage of distribution) for Load Test.
# 7 scenarios in total.
# Weight is a crucial parameter in an Artillery scenario.
# It defines the probability or percentage of virtual users that will run a particular scenario.

# For example, if duration is 10, arrival rate is 2, and ramp to is 10, Artillery will start by injecting 2 users per second
