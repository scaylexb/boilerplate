**Page Objects:**

- `page-objects/` - Reusable UI components following the Page Object Model pattern
- `page-objects/base/` - Base page classes and common functionality
- `page-objects/components/` - Individual UI component page objects

**Test Files:**

- `tests/e2e/` - End-to-end test specifications
- `tests/happy-path.e2e.spec.ts` - Critical user flow validation

**Support Files:**

- `fixtures/` - Test data and shared utilities
- `support/` - Helper functions, constants, and utilities

**Configuration:**

- `playwright.config.ts` - Playwright configuration and test settings
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration for tests

## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

Before running Playwright tests, ensure you have:

1. **Environment Configuration**: Set up your `.env` file with the required variables (see main testing README for details)
2. **Test Environment**: Ensure your storefront application is running and accessible
3. **Dependencies**: Install all required dependencies and Playwright browsers

### Test Execution

```bash
# Navigate to playwright directory
cd playwright

# Run all E2E tests
pnpm test:e2e

# Run specific test categories
pnpm test:e2e:happy-path

# Run tests with UI mode
pnpm test:e2e:ui
```

### Test Categories

**E2E Tests:**

- Complete user journey validation
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Mobile web testing
- Component interaction testing

**Happy Path Tests:**

- Critical user flow validation
- End-to-end purchase journey testing
- Authentication flow testing

### Debug and Development

```bash
# Run tests in headed mode (visible browser)
pnpm test:e2e --headed

# Run specific test file
pnpm test:e2e tests/e2e/account.e2e.spec.ts

# Run tests in debug mode
pnpm test:e2e --debug

# Generate test report
pnpm test:e2e --reporter=html
```

## Page Object Model

The Playwright suite uses the Page Object Model pattern for maintainable and reusable test code:

**Base Classes:**

- `BasePage` - Common functionality and utilities
- `BaseComponent` - Reusable component interactions

**Page Objects:**

- `HomePage` - Homepage interactions and elements
- `ProductDetailPage` - Product page functionality
- `BasketPage` - Shopping cart operations
- `CheckoutPage` - Checkout process management
- `AccountPage` - User account functionality

**Component Objects:**

- `Header` - Navigation and header elements
- `Search` - Search functionality and suggestions
- `Filters` - Product filtering and sorting
- `Pagination` - Page navigation controls

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Test Environment**: Always ensure you're running tests against appropriate environments:

- Use dedicated test environments (not production)
- Ensure test data is properly configured
- Verify all required services are running
- Monitor test execution for any failures

**Best Practices:**

- Use descriptive test names and organize by feature
- Follow the Page Object Model pattern for maintainable code
- Include both positive and negative test cases
- Keep tests independent and avoid dependencies between tests
- Use appropriate wait strategies and assertions
- Clean up test data after test execution

**Browser Support:**

- Chromium: Full feature support
- Firefox: Complete compatibility testing
- WebKit: Safari compatibility validation
- Mobile: Android Chrome and iOS Safari emulation
